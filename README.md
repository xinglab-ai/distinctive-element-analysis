# Motivation

The human brain represents an object by small elements and distinguishes two objects based on the difference in elements. Discovering the distinctive elements of high-dimensional datasets is therefore critical in numerous perception-driven biomedical studies. However, currently there is no available method for reliable extraction of distinctive elements of high-dimensional biomedical datasets. Here we present an unsupervised deep learning technique namely distinctive element analysis (DEA), which extracts the distinctive data elements using high-dimensional correlative information of the datasets. DEA computes a large number of distinctive elements, then filters and condenses the elements by employing a unique  triple-optimization network.   DEA has been found to improve the accuracy by 10-40\% in comparison to the traditional techniques in applications such as disease detection from medical images, gene ranking and cell recognition from scRNA-seq datasets. Moreover, DEA allows user-guided manipulation of the intermediate calculation process and thus offers intermediate results with better interpretability.
