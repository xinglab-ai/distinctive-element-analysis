%optimalKernelScale Optimal kernel scale for SVM learning.
%   SCALE=scaleOPT(X,Y,TYPE) estimates the optimal kernel scale
%   for SVM using the median distance to nearest neighbor. For two-class
%   learning, distance to nearest neighbor of the opposite class is used.
%   Possible values of TYPE are:
%       * 0 - regression 
%       * 1 - one-class learning
%       * 2 - two-class learning
%   For one-class learning and regression, optimalKernelScale ignores Y.
%   For two-class learning, pass Y as a vector with elements set to -1 and
%   +1.
